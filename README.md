# HomeLab
This repository documents my HomeLab setup for hands-on cybersecurity and sysadmin practice.

## Virtual Machine Setup

- **Attacker:** Kali Linux
- **Defender:** Ubuntu Linux

Each VM uses:
- **NAT Adapter** – Provides internet access.
- **Host-Only Adapter** – Enables internal communication between VMs on a private, isolated network.

Bridged mode was not possible due to Wi-Fi limitations in my apartment.

## Services on Ubuntu (Defender)

The Ubuntu VM runs the following stack to simulate vulnerable web applications:

- **Apache** – Web server
- **PHP** – Backend processing
- **MySQL** – Database service
- **DVWA** – Damn Vulnerable Web Application

---

## Network & Traffic Flow

1. **Kali VM** attacks the **Ubuntu VM** via the Host-Only network.
2. **DVWA** is served on the Ubuntu machine using Apache and PHP, with data stored in MySQL.
3. Both VMs can access the internet via their NAT adapters (e.g., to install packages or tools).

## 📌 Notes

- HomeLab setup for safe practice of vulnerability scanning, exploitation, and mitigation.
- Future plans: add firewall (`SafeLine`), intrusion detection, and log monitoring tools.
